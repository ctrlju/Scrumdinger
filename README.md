### SwiftUI Tutorials â€“ Scrumdinger App

Scrumdinger is an iOS app that helps teams manage their daily scrums. 

Scrums are short meetings where each attendee discusses what they accomplished yesterday, what they are working on today, and any obstacles that might impact their work.

To help keep scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that the users can refer to later.
